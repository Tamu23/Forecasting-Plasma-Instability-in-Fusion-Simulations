Introduction

California is home to a number of fusion research institutions, such as the LLNL in Livermore and the D3-D National Fusion Facility in San Diego. It is in San Diego that a Fusion Data Science and Digital Engineering Centre was established, in order to use machine learning to solve research problems. 
Using the 1-dimensional fusion reaction model created by Dr. Ken Owens, our task is to predict instability in the system, preferably enough time before the instability occurs in order to take appropriate preventative action. The goal therefore is to detect instability, detect it as early as possible, and be able to rely on a model that demonstrates the ability to improve considering the limited volume of data available currently.
